# Euphoria Examples

This is an example of how you could use Euphoria in one of your projects. All that you need is to install Euphoria and the CLI:

```bash
npm i -D euphoria euphoria-cli
```

And then, optionally, create a `euphoria.config.js` file to customize your Euphoria build.

Then, just run Euphoria on the command line to generate the CSS:

```bash
euphoria
```

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now run `npm run build` to generate Euphoria CSS or run `npm start` to rebuild Euphoria CSS every time the configuration file changes.

Now open up the `index.html` file in your browser. You can now make changes to the `euphoria.config.js` file and reload the page and see your changes reflected.
